# Awesome Prompt Design
Curated list of resources about writing prompts for AI: Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, etc

To keep the main list on-topic, I've shuffled some resources onto separate pages:
- [Slightly less awesome items](semi-awesomeness.md)
- [General AI Awesomeness](general-ai-awesomeness.md)


## Images

* [img2prompt](https://replicate.com/methexis-inc/img2prompt): turn any image into a text prompt
* [prompt parrot](https://github.com/kyrick/cog-prompt-parrot): generate variations on a text prompt
* [types of film](https://www.lomography.com/films) to guide photography styles in prompting
* [Prompt Combinator](https://wainwrightmark.github.io/prompt-combinator/): systematically generate all possible permutations from a group of elements
* Artist styles: which artists can you imitate in [Dall-E](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d-N9BZ80qw3v2_3gWctYkRVuoMx6zs_We6c3h_yACJY/edit#gid=0) or [Midjourney](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d-N9BZ80qw3v2_3gWctYkRVuoMx6zs_We6c3h_yACJY/edit#gid=0)? Or check this huge [compilation of artist styles](https://asc.fooo.ooo/) for inspiration

### Libraries

see also [General AI Awesomeness](general-ai-awesomeness.md) for more tools

- [Langchain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) -- python library to manage the plumbing work around LLMs. For instance, use it to summarize documents you have and include them within your prompt
- [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/python-preview) - "a lightweight SDK enabling integration of AI Large Language Models (LLMs) with conventional programming languages"
- [Lambdaprompt](https://github.com/approximatelabs/lambdaprompt) - "Write LLM prompts with jinja templates, compose them in python as functions, and call them directly or use them as a webservice"
- [Llamaindex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index): link your data to LLMs, using data connectors and indices

##  Communities

* Reddit: [Prompt Design](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptDesign/).
